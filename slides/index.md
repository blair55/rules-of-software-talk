## Rules of Software Development

' not really about any work
' more like observations, not like tdd
' these rules come from software as I go through I'll try to apply them more generally to our business and in general
' hopefully you'll find it interesting

***

### Occam's Razor

> The simplest answer is usually correct

' quite popular, william of ockham 14th century

' if you have competing theories, first investigate the one with the least assumptions
' explain razor

### Hanlon's Razor

> Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity

' extension of Occam's Razor
' never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity
' has to be remembered in software when people are asking for requirements or users creating errors
' but important because we have to work and get on with each other as people

### Eagleson's Law

> Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else

' particularly pertinent
' documentation vs descriptive, declarative code
' don't make it difficult for the next person because it could be you

### Conway's Law

> Organisations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the organisation

' Not necessarily a problem until your organisation becomes large & complex,
' large complex organisation = large complex software
' secret to large complex software is to build lots of small simple pieces
' organisations have to adopt modularity to achieve this
' netflix/amazon have small autonomous teams enforces modularity
' result is that they are very flexible
' break the problem down
